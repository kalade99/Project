        <br/>

            or
            
            <br/>    
            
              choose any of our suggestable daily meals and try it yourself!
            
              <br/>
            
            or
            
            <br/>
            
             be one of the people who wish to share their favourite meal by doing a tutorial and join our platform.
            
            Our daily meals include all courses and lessons for free which are streamed everyday at different time. Some of them are being streamed live, some are videos made by others. 
            
            With this platform we hope to create a sharing community which would help people coping with stress and depression. By sharing our own skills and experiences we can help lots of people to not feel alone anymore.
            <br/>
            
            
             The shedule is being updated every weeks Friday so stay tuned!
